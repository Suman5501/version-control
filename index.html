    <p>
      <h2>What is "Version control" system?</h2>
      <h3><em>Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code.</em></h3>
       <p>If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare 
      changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if we screw things up or lose files, we can easily recover. In addition, we get all this for very little overhead.</p>
  
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Use of Version Control System:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A repository: It can be thought as a database of changes. It contains all the edits and historical versions (snapshots) of the project.</li>
        <li>Copy of Work (sometimes called as checkout): It is the personal copy of all the files in a project. You can edit to this copy, without affecting the work of others and you can finally commit your changes to a repository when you are done making your changes.</li>
      </ul>
   
    <h3>Types of Version Control Systems:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Local Version Control Systems </li>
      <li>Centralized Version Control Systems</li>
      <li>Distributed Version Control Systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Git Commands -</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><h4>git commit:</h4>
    Records the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID.Itâ€™s best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit. Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.</li>
    <li><h4>git clone:</h4><br>To create a local working copy of an existing remote repository, use git clone to copy and download the repository to a computer. Cloning is the equivalent of git init when working with a remote repository. Git will create a directory locally with all files and repository history.</li>
    <li><h4>git pull:</h4>To get the latest version of a repository run git pull. This pulls the changes from the remote repository to the local computer.</li>
    <li><h4>git push:</h4>Sends local commits to the remote repository. git push requires two parameters: the remote repository and the branch that the push is for.</li>
  </ol>
